What is flexsolve?
------------------

flexsolve presents a flexible set of function solvers by defining alternative
tolerance conditions for accepting a solution. These solvers also implement
methods like Wegstein and Aitken-Steffensen acceleration to reach solutions
quicker.

Installation
------------

Get the latest version of flexsolve from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flexsolve/>`__. If you have an installation of Python with pip, simple install it with:

    $ pip install flexsolve

To get the git version, run:

    $ git clone git://github.com/yoelcortes/flexsolve

Documentation
-------------

Flexsolve solvers can solve a variety of specifications:

* Solve x where f(x) = x (iterative):

  * **fixed_point**: Simple fixed point iteration.

  * **wegstein**: Wegstein's accelerated iteration method.

  * **aitken**: Aitken-Steffensen accelerated iteration method.

* Solve x where f(x) = 0 and x0 < x < x1 (bounded):

  * **bisection**: Simple bisection method

  * **false_position**: Simple false position method.

  * **IQ_interpolation**: Inverse quadratic interpolation solver (similar to `scipy.optimize.brentq <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.brentq.html>`__)

* Solve x where f(x) = 0 (open):

  * **secant**: Simple secant method.

  * **aitken_secant**: Secant method with Aitken acceleration.

Parameters for each solver are pretty consitent and straight forward:

* **f**: objective function in the form of `f(x, *args)`.

* **x**: 
  
  * Iterative solvers: Root guess. Solver begins the iteration by evaluating `f(x)`.

* **x0, x1**: 

  * Bounded solvers: Root bracket. Solution must lie within `x0` and `x1`.
  
  * Open solvers: Initial and second guess. Second guess, 'x1', is optional.
  
* **xtol=0.**: Solver stops when the root lies within `xtol`.

* **ytol=5e-8**: Solver stops when the f(x) lies within `ytol` of the root. Iterative solvers (which solve functions of the form f(x) = x) do not accept a `ytol` argument as xtol and ytol are actually mathematically equivalent.

* **args=()**: Arguments to pass to `f`.

* **maxiter=50**: Maximum number of iterations.

* **checkiter=True**: Whether to raise a Runtimer error when tolerance could not be satisfied before the maximum number of iterations.

* **checkroot=False**: Whether satisfying both tolerances, `xtol` and `ytol`, are required for termination.

* **checkbounds=True**: Whether to raise a ValueError when in a bounded solver when the root is not certain to lie within bounds (i.e. f(x0) * f(x1) > 0.).

Here are some examples using flexsolve's Profiler object to test and compare
different solvers. In the graphs, the points are the solver iterations and 
the lines represent f(x). The lines and points are offset to make them more visible
(so all the points are actually on the same curve!). The shaded area is just to 
help us relate the points to the curve (not an actual interval):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import flexsolve as flx 
    >>> from scipy import optimize as opt
    >>> x0, x1 = [-5, 5]
    >>> f = lambda x: x**3 - 40 + 2*x 
    >>> p = flx.Profiler(f) # When called, it returns f(x) and saves the results.
    >>> opt.brentq(p, x0, x1, xtol=1e-8)

If your project is need for speed, you can speed up calculations in flexsolve
using the **speed_up()** method, which works by `jit <https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/index.html>`__
compiling computationally-heavy algorithms in flexsolve. The following example benchmarks flexsolve's speed
with and without compiling:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import flexsolve as flx
    >>> f = lambda x: x**3 - 40 + 2*x 
    >>> # Time solver without compiling
    >>> %timeit flx.IQ_interpolation(f, -5, 5)
    9.81 µs ± 131 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
    >>> flx.speed_up() # This is the only line we need to run to speed up flexsolve
    >>> # First run is slower because it need to compile
    >>> x = flx.IQ_interpolation(f, -5, 5) 
    >>> # Time solver after compiling
    >>> %timeit flx.IQ_interpolation(f, -5, 5)
    7.01 µs ± 88.4 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)
    
It is also possible to use compiled flexsolve solvers as part of jit-compiled 
code:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from numba import njit
    >>> import flexsolve as flx
    >>> flx.speed_up() # Not necessary if previous example was run
    >>> f = njit(lambda x: x**3 - 40 + 2*x) # Must be jit compiled to run in other compiled code
    >>> # For demonstration purposes, the high level compiled function is a silly one liner
    >>> solve_x = njit(lambda: flx.IQ_interpolation(f, -5., 5.))
    >>> x = solve_x() # First run is slow because it needs to compile
    >>> %timeit solve_x()
    139 ns ± 2.08 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
    
The iterative methods for solving f(x) = x (e.g. fixed-point, Wegstain, Aitken) are 
capable of solving multi-dimensional problems. Simply make sure x is an array 
and f(x) returns an array with the same dimensions. In fact, the
`The Biorefinery Simulation and Techno-Economic Analysis Modules (BioSTEAM) <https://biosteam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ 
uses flexsolve to solve many chemical engineering problems, including 
process recycle stream flow rates and vapor-liquid equilibrium.
